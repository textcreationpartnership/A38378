            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GAllant Souldiers, you who God hath honoured with ſucceſſe, to the admiration of your friends, and aſtoniſhment of your enemies: Now let us ſee whether you will prove faithfull to England yea, or no: VVHether the publicke peace and welfare of this poore ſinking Kingdome; be of ſo high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, with you, as your owne eaſe and particular intereſt or no; if you dare not truſt God at Jordan, which hath wrought wonders for you in the wilderneſſe; delivered you out of the hands of Pharaoh; and brought you through the Red-Sea; if you will ſay after all this Manna, but can God give us fleſh alſo; if yee will thus diſhonour God before the People; yee may come with Moſes to ſee that good Land that ſhall flow with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and peace; but not poſſeſſe it. [Therefore be of good courage, and let us play the men for our People, and for the City of our God, and the Lord doe that which ſeemeth him good: 2 Sam. 1. 12.]</p>
            <p>If yee have hitherto had conſidence in your owne wiſedome and ſtrength. If yee have hitherto ſought your owne exaltation and ſelfe intereſts in your actings. If yee hitherto preferred your owne pay and Arreares; your owne honour, and vindication; before the publick peace and welfare of the Kingdome; let us know it; do not diſſemble any longer with us; let us have ſome time to prepare our ſelves to become ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But if God have hitherto been your wiſdome and ſtrength; if the Kingdomes peace and ſafety have been of greater value with
<pb facs="tcp:51754:3"/> you then our own lives; if it hath beene the honour and glory of God; you hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more, then your owne vindication and reputation; why is it not ſo ſtill? Did we ever thinke you would be mercinary Souldiers, you are not all French and Scotch, ſure there is ſome of you free-borne Engliſh-men; wee thought you had been equally intereſted with us in the common-wealths good. VVhat, have you loſt your intereſt and freedomes by fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them? If yee had beene in France ſighting there for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney againſt Spaine, yee might have demanded as much there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your disbanding, as you have requeſted here yet.</p>
            <p>Surely there is ſome other grievances lies upon your ſpirits, beſides particular intereſt, as arreares, Indemnity, Vindication; you pretend in your Declaration you could wiſh other things; wee hope your expectations in relation to your worke, will be equall to that of your wages. Have you taken all this paine, and put us to all this coſt to ſet up the building of a well grounded peace, and will ye leave it ſo ſlightly pind, as the leaſt blaſt of wind ſhall blow it over againe, and ſo make our latter end worſe then our beginning?</p>
            <p>But wee hope you cannot, you dare not thus deale with us. The generallity of your carriage and demeanour amongſt us, hath promiſed better things; your ſeverall Declarations to your Souldiers in the behalfe of the Country, as you marched along, your ſincere and exemplary proceedings againſt any of them that did us any wrong; cannot but beget better thoughts in us towards you.</p>
            <p>For wee muſt confeſſe, wee never could diſtinguiſh betwixt Caveliers and Roundheads by their carriage amongſt us, till you were an Army, or at leaſt a great part of you in armes for us; and ſince God hath made you uſefull to affect many of us to the Parliament, by your faire carriage to us: Doe not leave us till in ſome meaſure wee be aſſured of our expectation; leſt we have luſt cauſe to ſay, you have therein beene a ſnare to us.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee declare to you, if you disband or lay downe Armes, before wee have ſome farther and fuller aſſurance of a peaceable enioyment of our liberties and freedomes, and to live under the government and protection of our knowne Lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:51754:3"/> which you have often times pretended you fought to maintain, you doe as much as in you lies betray us into bondage and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; had wee not been conquered into ſubiection to arbitrary government, wee ſhould never have been voted to it; therefore for your farther ſatisfaction concerning not diſ-banding, wee ſhall referre to your conſideration theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe we cnoceive you did not take up armes to defend either boundleſſe prerogative, or unlimitted priviledges, but to maintaine the common liberties of all the free-borne People of England, againſt all tyrannicall uſurpations, and uniuſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by whomſoever exerciſed; and ſince by the bleſſing of God, you have delivered your ſelves and Kingdome from the former; wee conceive its your duty to doe your utmoſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from the latter, at leſt to let us know where the cauſe lyes wee are not eaſed of our unſupportable burdens, and ſetled in the enioyment of our Juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Liberties and freedomes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe (we conceive) you are not engaged in this warre by any mercenary conſiderations, of profits or preferments, but as men equally intereſted in the things ye fought for. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you choſen and intruſted by the Kingdome as members of the Parliament; and you thereby are as equally concerned in the proceedings of the Parliament, be they good or bad, as you are in the actings of the Army; and what you have done or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do for the Kingdome as Parliament men, you ought to do your utmoſt to maintaine and make good as you are Souldiers: and conſidering that the late proceedings of the Parliament have beene abſolute contrary to their former Declarations, and Proteſtations, whereby they will not only bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but you, the guilt of all the blood which hath been ſhed in pretence of oppoſing tyranny and oppreſſion; when at this preſent there is more arbitrary tyranny and oppreſſion, upon the poore Commons, then ever there was ſince man can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; which wee hope you will not be the authors of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe this preſent Parliament is not a free Parliament, there being many of the late elections have had undue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the choyce of new members, they having not been left to the free choyce of the People, but have been firſt choſe by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="tcp:51754:4"/> Parliament men, and then recommended by inſinuating Letters to the ſeverall Counties and Corporations they are choſen by; which by reaſon of that influence ſome Committees and ſome others, had over the ſaid Counties and places, they durſt not doe other but chooſe them: many of the ſame mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which thus chuſeth others, are themſelves guilty of high miſdemeanour, ſome of them having long, lyen under the charge of betraying their truſt, others of ingroſing the publicke ſtock into their own hands, and ſo have cheated the Common-wealth of vaſt ſummes of money; and for their owne ſecurity of being accomptable to the Kingdome for what they have done, have they procured by thoſe uniuſt elections ſuch men as are either intereſted with themſelves in ſome guilt to the publicke as they have been Country Committees; or elſe ſuch as they have had particular intereſt in, and relation to, and ſo might corrupt and ſway them at their pleaſure; by which meanes you had of late the maior part of the Houſe carried on to ſuch contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proceedings to their former Declarations, and Proteſtations; they having beene more mindfull of deviding the Common-wealths money among themſelves, then they have beene of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Common-wealths iuſt debts; as if they were reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to leave raiſing of money as long as the Commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands be worth a penny.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the end of your diſ-banding, is not to eaſe us of the charge of an Army, there being already proviſion made to continve an Army every whit as chargeable, and to be feared will be more oppreſſive, and abuſive to us then ever you have beene: but their deſigne is (as faſt as they can accompliſh it) to new modelize the Army and Parliament too; and to intruſt none but ſuch, as are equally guilty with themſelves, or in ſome kind intereſted in their deſign, which is to diſ-throne the King, and inſlave the People, and ſet themſelves up as Lords and Kings in his roome, and ſo in ſtead of having an Army to protect us, wee ſhall have an Army in our owne bowels, paid by us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us; but wee hope ſince you expect your due in point of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from us, you will give us leave to tell you wee expect the performance of your duty in point of faithfulneſſe from you
<pb facs="tcp:51754:4"/> hardly thinking you can in honeſty or conſcience demand all your areares or wages till you have brought your work to ſome fuller perfection, for if you leave us thus, you leave us in a worſe condition then you found us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe we have found more Juſtice and benefit from our truſtees in Parliament, within theſe ten daies, ſince you have ſtood up and declared for us, then wee had formerly received in ten monethes, when you ſtood as it were Neuters to us: as witneſſe thoſe ſelfe-denying Votes; The taking off the Exciſe from fleſh and Salt, except their deſires to haſten the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the King: their approving your Petition, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your grievances; their relieving the neceſſities of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reformado Officers which formerly were out of hopes; all which makes us confident, that if according to your declaring there were a period ſet to this Parliament, and proviſion made for further Parliaments to ſucceed one another, whereby Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments might know they were queſtionable, for their actions at ſuch a period of time, and ſhould then expect to find an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall communicating of Juſtice to all the free-borne People of this Kingdome: and wee cannot expect it before. Therefore we declare to you, if you will ſtand by us in thoſe iuſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall things you have declared to us, wee are reſolved to ſtand by you, and own you in them, to the utmoſt of our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and laſt drop of our blood.</p>
